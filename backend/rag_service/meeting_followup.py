# County of Santa Barbara Zero Emission Vehicle Plan context
ZEV_PLAN_CONTEXT = '''
County of Santa Barbara Zero-Emission Vehicle Plan (ZEVP)
2030 Climate Action Plan (CAP) aims to reduce community-wide emissions 50% by 2030 (below 2018 levels).
On-road vehicle transportation accounts for 48% of the Countyâ€™s GHG emissions. As of 2022, ZEVs make up less than 2% of all vehicles on the road in Santa Barbara County.
The ZEV Plan supports the transition to zero-emission transportation and increases access to clean mobility options. It identifies gaps, barriers, and challenges to planning, education, and infrastructure deployment, and develops strategies to meet internal county operations and community needs.
The plan also identifies opportunities to increase equitable adoption of clean transportation modes including electric vehicles (EVs), electrified transit, micro-mobility and shared mobility devices and services, and emerging technologies.
Action categories include Planning and Policy, Infrastructure Deployment, Programmatic Actions, and Outreach, Education, & Engagement.
Example actions: require charging infrastructure in new buildings, conduct mobility needs assessments, create EV charging station manuals, install EV stations, expand shared mobility pilots, workplace charging programs, pilot fleet electrification, battery recycling, and equitable workforce development.
